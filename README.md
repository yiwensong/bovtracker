Single MTT Stats for Bovada

Eventually, we'll use matplotlib to plot stuff...

But for now, put in an input file and the thing will output a CSV for you to use on Excel. Great value.

Todo list:

- Multiple results input
- -o for selection of output file
- Stats by hold cards
- Hand odds
- All in EV?
- Find a way to database info
- Find something to do with the database
